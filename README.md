# My personal website
I made this website in RStudio using the hugo academic theme (https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) 
and then uploaded it to github and hosted it through netlify. 
This is my first time ever using (really editing templates of) html + css to make a website! 

For my sake (as well as anyone else who might see this), 
here are the websites + guides + resources I used heavily:

+ Lucy McGowan's website (https://www.lucymcgowan.com/) + github (https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/lucymcgowan)
+ her blog post on making a website (https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/08/08/how-to-make-an-rmarkdown-website/)
+ Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/?category=Serif)
+ blogdown guides (https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/custom-layouts.html)
+ markdown syntax guides (https://sourceforge.net/p/hugo-generator/wiki/markdown_syntax/#md_ex_img + https://learn.netlify.com/en/cont/markdown/)
+ css spacing guides (https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/stylesheets/cssspacing.html)
+ hugo academic instructions (https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/deployment/)
+ hugo tutorials (https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/)
+ font awesome gallery (https://learn.netlify.com/en/cont/icons/)

+ github (https://github.com/amandazheutlin/amanda-zheutlin)
+ RStudio and rmarkdown cheatsheet (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html)
+ another blog (https://talesofr.wordpress.com/2017/08/18/starting-a-rmarkdown-blog-with-bookdown-hugo-github/)
+ and another one (https://github.com/fliptanedo/FlipWebsite2017 + https://theory.ucr.edu/flip/)
+ also tried a simpler version of this via instuctions from Emily Zabor  (http://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html) --> https://amandazheutlin.github.io/MyWebsite/
+ originally inspired to make a website using R from Monica Gerber (http://www.monicagerber.com/) + her github (https://github.com/monicagerber/my-website)
