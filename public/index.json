To overcome small individual effect sizes, one approach is to create a polygenic risk score combining risk across SNPs (including those below the significance threshold) and weighted individually by their effect sizes. Here, we directly tested whether polygenic variants associated with an endophenotype for schizophrenia – verbal memory performance – in healthy controls (HC) predicted memory performance in independent HC and schizophrenia patient (SZ) samples. We also explicitly tested the implications of the common variant, common disease model by examining the relationship between endophenotype-generated polygenic scores and schizophrenia-related polygenic risk scores in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Caucasian healthy controls (N = 649) and schizophrenia patients (N = 58) recruited for the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics, as well as SZ (N = 61) and HC (N = 63) subjects recruited from the Swedish Twin Registry, completed the California Verbal Learning Task, a list-learning measure of verbal memory. A bootstrapping analysis of associations between CVLT performance and common variants was run (1000 iterations) in the CNP control sample and multiple cut-points (SNPs present in 700, 800, and 900 of 1000 associations) were used to calculate CVLT polygenic scores. Schizophrenia risk scores were calculated using variants identified by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium in a large case-control sample. RESULTS: Polygenic memory scores derived from weights based on the CNP control sample revealed significant associations with CVLT performance in the Swedish HC sample, as well as the CNP SZ sample. Higher schizophrenia risk scores were associated with lower CVLT polygenic scores (CVLT scores and performance are positively correlated) in both patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: Polygenic memory scores reflecting variation in CVLT performance in healthy controls significantly predicted CVLT performance in independent HC and SZ samples. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of polygenic scores derived from an endophenotype-based, genome-wide association study in schizophrenia successfully predicting the same phenotype (i.e., memory performance) in an independent sample. Furthermore, the relationship between schizophrenia risk scores and CVLT-derived scores provides the first genome-wide, molecular genetic evidence of the shared etiology between episodic memory performance and schizophrenia.","tags":[],"title":"Common variants for schizophrenia ascertained through genome-wide association of a cognitive endophenotype","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

However, this method offers no insight into which genes or combinations of genes drive these effects. Furthermore, it cannot capture complex, non-linear effects (i.e., multi-gene interactions), which are known to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. METHODS: We used random forest, an ensemble machine-learning approach, to predict six cognitive phenotypes in a sample of patients and controls (N = 739) using genetic variants previously identified in a large genome-wide association study of schizophrenia. Cross-validation was applied to the discovery sample and results were validated in an independent sample of similar ancestry (N = 364). For comparison, we ran generalized linear models (GLM) including all variants, as well as calculated polygenic scores, to predict each of the same outcomes. RESULTS: Random forest models for visual memory, verbal memory, and processing speed replicated in an independent sample. Conversely, no GLM models replicated and polygenic scores for only one cognitive outcome significantly predicted performance in an independent sample. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying genotypic patterns can increase the predictive power of genotypes on cognitive phenotypes, suggesting that genetic effects on cognition may depend on particular combinations. As such, pattern analysis can provide an advance in genotype-phenotype mapping that may aid in delineating the neurobiological pathways by which known risk loci for schizophrenia confer vulnerability.","tags":[],"title":"Multivariate pattern analysis of schizophrenia-associated genetic variants in relation to cognitive endophenotypes","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

Given the substantial heritability of many psychiatric disorders, quantitative measures of genetic risk may be useful towards this end. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), in particular, are easy and cheap to generate and can be calculated well before illness onset. However, their utility for predicting clinical diagnoses collected in a real-world clinical setting remains unclear as PRS have typically been applied only in research samples. Furthermore, the specificity of these risk scores, especially given the overlap of genetic risk across psychiatric disorders, remains unassessed in a clinical setting. METHODS: As part of the PsycheMERGE Consortium, we generated PRS for several psychiatric disorders using summary statistics available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and applied them to real-world clinical datasets from three large-scale, independent healthcare systems. PRS were calculated for individuals of European-American ancestry with genomic data from the Partners Healthcare Biobank (N=15,363), Vanderbilt University Medical Center biobank (BioVU) (N=11,647) and Geisinger Health System MyCode dataset (N=23,296). Associations between each PRS and all medical outcomes available in patient electronic health records were assessed using univariate logistic regression in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). Medical outcomes were defined using ‘phecodes’: a hierarchical grouping of ICD-9 diagnostic codes used to reduce tens of thousands of individual codes into fewer than 2000 disease categories. Cases for a given phecode had two or more relevant ICD-9 codes, and phecodes with 100 cases or fewer were excluded. All tests were corrected for the number of phecodes tested using a Bonferroni adjustment. RESULTS: Patterns of results were remarkably similar across health systems and reflected many predicted associations. For example, schizophrenia PRS was associated with schizophrenia in all three health systems (p’s DISCUSSION: We have provided an important proof-of-concept demonstration of the utility of PRS using real-world clinical diagnoses across multiple health care systems. Across three independent clinical samples, the associations were remarkably consistent and particularly strong for psychiatric disorders. These results suggest psychiatric PRS could be applied with relative success and specificity in hospital settings, elevating their potential for risk stratification efforts in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Penetrance and pleiotropy of polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia in 90,000 patients across three healthcare systems","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

We investigated gene expression pathways within these cells to nominate cellular systems that may be important to cortical maturation during conversion to psychosis. METHODS: We used a forward stepwise regression algorithm to identify microRNA expression – hub regulators of mRNA – in peripheral leukocytes associated with annualized rate of reduction in gray matter in a subsample of NAPLS (N=74). RESULTS: Nine microRNAs were included in a single classifier for cortical thinning, p=3.63 x 10-08, R2=.358, permutation-based p=.039, the mRNA targets of which were enriched for intracellular signaling pathways involved in coordinating inflammatory responses within immune cells (pCONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs identified here have been previously linked to brain development, synaptic plasticity, immune function and/or schizophrenia, demonstrating some convergence across studies and methodologies.

Genetic profiling is one approach to risk stratification that has been extensively validated in research cohorts, but its utility in clinical settings remains largely unexplored. Moreover, the broad health consequences of a high genetic risk of schizophrenia are poorly understood, despite being highly relevant to treatment decisions. METHODS: We used electronic health records of 91,980 patients from three large healthcare systems to evaluate the penetrance and pleiotropy of genetic risk for schizophrenia. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia were calculated from meta-analysis summary statistics and tested for association with schizophrenia diagnostic codes and 1338 code-defined disease categories in a phenome-wide association study. Effect estimates were meta-analyzed across sites, and follow-up analyses evaluated the effect of a schizophrenia diagnosis. RESULTS: PRSs were robustly associated with schizophrenia (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in PRS = 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-1.8], p = 1.25 x 10-16) and patients in the highest risk decile of the PRS distribution had a four-fold increased odds of schizophrenia compared to those in the bottom decile (95% CI, 2.4-6.5, p = 4.43 x 10-8). PRSs were also associated with other psychiatric phenotypes, including anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorders, personality disorders, and suicidal behavior. Non-psychiatric associations included heart palpitations, urinary syndromes, obesity, and nonspecific somatic symptoms. Most associations remained significant when conditioning on a diagnosis of schizophrenia, indicating genetic pleiotropy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that an available measure of genetic risk for schizophrenia is robustly associated with schizophrenia in healthcare settings and has pleiotropic effects on related psychiatric disorders as well as other medical symptoms and syndromes. Our results provide an initial indication of the opportunities and limitations that may arise with the future application of PRS testing in healthcare systems.","tags":[],"title":"Penetrance and pleiotropy of polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia in 90,000 patients across three healthcare systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/https://amandazheutlin.github.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/https:/amandazheutlin.github.io/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["SR Chekroud","R Gueorguieva","\u003cb\u003eAB Zheutlin\u003c/b\u003e","M Paulus","HM Krumholz","JH Krystal","AM Chekroud"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1535774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535774400,"objectID":"36c19a107c6be4ebce3a3974fe9753fb","permalink":"/https://amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/brfss/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/https:/amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/brfss/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Exercise is known to be associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes, but its association with mental health remains unclear.

Heritable prefrontal fMRI activation during working memory (WM) is such a phenotype. We hypothesized that urban upbringing (childhood urbanicity) would alter this phenotype and interact with dopamine genes that regulate prefrontal function during WM. Further, dopamine has been hypothesized to mediate urban-associated factors like social stress. WM-related prefrontal function was tested for main effects of urbanicity, main effects of three dopamine genes—catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)—and, importantly, dopamine gene-by-urbanicity interactions. For COMT, three independent human samples were recruited (total n = 487). We also studied 253 subjects genotyped for DRD1 and DRD2. 3T fMRI activation during the N-back WM task was the dependent variable, while childhood urbanicity, dopamine genotype, and urbanicity-dopamine interactions were independent variables. Main effects of dopamine genes and of urbanicity were found. Individuals raised in an urban environment showed altered prefrontal activation relative to those raised in rural or town settings. For each gene, dopamine genotype-by-urbanicity interactions were shown in prefrontal cortex–COMT replicated twice in two independent samples. An urban childhood upbringing altered prefrontal function and interacted with each gene to alter genotype-phenotype relationships. Gene-environment interactions between multiple dopamine genes and urban upbringing suggest that neural effects of developmental environmental exposure could mediate, at least partially, increased risk for psychiatric illness in urban environments via dopamine genes expressed into adulthood.","tags":[],"title":"Interaction of childhood urbanicity and variation in dopamine genes alters adult prefrontal function as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eAB Zheutlin\u003c/b\u003e","AM Chekroud","R Polimanti","J Gelernter","FW Sabb","RM Bilder","N Freimer","ED London","CM Hultman","TD Cannon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1519880400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519880400,"objectID":"5d7924a84de962bfda7e1973cc488997","permalink":"/https://amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/108-ml-cog/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/https:/amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/108-ml-cog/","section":"publication","summary":"Genetic risk variants for schizophrenia have been linked to many related clinical and biological phenotypes with the hopes of delineating how individual variation across thousands of variants corresponds to the clinical and etiologic heterogeneity within schizophrenia. This has primarily been done using risk score profiling, which aggregates effects across all variants into a single predictor. While effective, this method lacks flexibility in certain domains: risk scores cannot capture nonlinear effects and do not employ any variable selection. We used random forest, an algorithm with this flexibility designed to maximize predictive power, to predict 6 cognitive endophenotypes in a combined sample of psychiatric patients and controls (N = 739) using 77 genetic variants strongly associated with schizophrenia. Tenfold cross-validation was applied to the discovery sample and models were externally validated in an independent sample of similar ancestry (N = 336). Linear approaches, including linear regression and task-specific polygenic risk scores, were employed for comparison. Random forest models for processing speed (P = .019) and visual memory (P = .036) and risk scores developed for verbal (P = .042) and working memory (P = .037) successfully generalized to an independent sample with similar predictive strength and error. As such, we suggest that both methods may be useful for mapping a limited set of predetermined, disease-associated SNPs to related phenotypes. Incorporating random forest and other more flexible algorithms into genotype–phenotype mapping inquiries could contribute to parsing heterogeneity within schizophrenia; such algorithms can perform as well as standard methods and can capture a more comprehensive set of potential relationships.","tags":[],"title":"Multivariate pattern analysis of genotype–phenotype relationships in schizophrenia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["DM Allswede","\u003cb\u003eAB Zheutlin\u003c/b\u003e","Y Chung","K Anderson","CM Hultman","M Ingvar","TD Cannon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1517461200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517461200,"objectID":"728780e2f2c889b389b8e79787361746","permalink":"/https://amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/complement/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/https:/amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/complement/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent work suggests that genes encoding complement proteins that are active in the innate immune system may confer risk for schizophrenia by disrupting typical synaptic pruning in late adolescence. Alterations in the complement pathway may contribute to aberrant cortical thinning in schizophrenia prodromes and reduced prefrontal cortical thickness in chronic schizophrenia patients; however, this theory needs to be translated to humans. We conducted a series of analyses in a sample of adult Swedish twins enriched for schizophrenia (N=129) to assess the plausibility of a relationship between complement gene expression and cortical thickness that could go awry in the etiology of schizophrenia. First, we identified that peripheral mRNA expression levels of two complement genes (C5, SERPING1) made unique contributions to the variance in superior frontal cortical thickness among all participants. Vertex-wise maps of the association between gene expression levels and thickness across the cortex suggested that this relationship was especially strong with SERPING1 in the superior frontal region, consistent with the pattern of disruption in cortical thickness observed in schizophrenia. Additional analyses identified that these genes are expressed in the human superior frontal cortex, that heritable genetic factors influence SERPING1 gene expression levels, and that these associations are observed regardless of case status. These findings provide initial evidence linking the complement system with cortical thinning in humans, a process potentially involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.","tags":[],"title":"Complement gene expression predicts superior temporal cortical thickness in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["NJ Bradshaw","L Ukkola-Vuoti","M Pankakoski","\u003cb\u003eAB Zheutlin\u003c/b\u003e","A Ortega-Alonso","M Torniainen-Holm","V Sinha","S Therman","T Paunio","J Suvisaari","J Lonnqvist","TD Cannon","J Haukka","W Hennah"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1509508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509508800,"objectID":"328734fe3e3bd928f5182b6d40cfd802","permalink":"/https://amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/nde1/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/https:/amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/nde1/","section":"publication","summary":"Genetic studies of familial schizophrenia in Finland have observed significant associations with a group of biologically related genes, DISC1, NDE1, NDEL1, PDE4B and PDE4D, the ‘DISC1 network’.

Gene expression levels were determined in 64 individuals from 18 families, while prescription medication information has been collected over a 10-year period for 931 affected individuals. We demonstrate that the NDE1 SNP rs2242549 associates with significant changes in gene expression for 2908 probes (2542 genes), of which 794 probes (719 genes) were replicable. A significant number of the genes altered were predicted targets of microRNA-484 (p = 3.0 × 10−8), located on a non-coding exon of NDE1. Variants within the NDE1 locus also displayed significant genotype by gender interaction to early cessation of psychoactive medications metabolized by CYP2C19. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-484 can affect the expression of CYP2C19 in a cell culture system. Thus, variation at the NDE1 locus may alter risk of mental illness, in part through modification of miR-484, and such modification alters treatment response to specific psychoactive medications, leading to the potential for use of this locus in targeting treatment.","tags":[],"title":"The *NDE1* genomic locus can affect treatment of psychiatric illness through gene expression changes related to microRNA-484","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Gupta","B Qaiser","L He","TS Hiekkalinna","\u003cb\u003eAB Zheutlin\u003c/b\u003e","S Therman","M Ollikainen","S Ripatti","M Perola","V Salomaa","L Milani","TD Cannon","PAF Madden","T Korhonen","J Kaprio","A Loukola"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1501560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501560000,"objectID":"933808edf3e4b6016f9d9964b683b8c2","permalink":"/https://amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/neuregulin/","publishdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/https:/amandazheutlin.github.io/publication/neuregulin/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding molecular processes that link comorbid traits such as addictions and mental disorders can provide novel therapeutic targets.
